DEFINITIONS:
prime meridian - 0 longitude at greenwich
longitude - angle around earth east-to-west, divides into vertical segments
latitude - angle around earth north-to-south, divides into horizontal segments
right ascension - angle around east-to-west from vernal equinox

ecliptic plane - plane of earth's orbit around sun
celestial equator - plane of earth's equator
obliquity/axial tilt - celestial equator tilted by 23.5 degrees relative to ecliptic plane
equinox - where celestial equator and ecliptic plane intersect i.e. axis of rotation of ecliptic to get celestial equator
    - technically, the two points that define this axis (vernal and autumnal)

julian day - day since 4713 BC
j2000 - day since 2000 AD
gmst - angle between greenwich prime meridian and vernal equinox

ECI (earth-centred inertial coordinates) - x,y,z - fixed
equatorial - declination, right ascension - fixed (equivalent to ECI with different units)
ECF (earth-centred fixed coordinates) - x,y,z - rotating with x axis through prime meridian
geodetic - latitude, longitude - rotating (equivalent to ECF with different units)
ecliptic - declination, right ascension - fixed

inclo - inclination
nodeo - right ascension of ascending node
argpo - argument of periapsis
no - mean motion 
ecco - eccentricity
a - semi-major axis - a^3 = mu/no^2
b - semi-minor axis - b^2 = a^2(1-e^2)
c - distance from foci to centre of ellipse - c^2 = a^2 - b^2
periapsis - closest approach
apoapsis - furthest approach
