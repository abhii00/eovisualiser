prime meridian - 0 longitude at greenwich
longitude - angle around earth east-to-west, divides into vertical segments
latitude - angle around earth north-to-south, divides into horizontal segments

ecliptic plane - plane of earth's orbit around sun
celestial equator - plane of earth's equator

    - technically, the two points that define this axis (vernal and autumnal)
